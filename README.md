[my-website]: https://AJG91.github.io "my-website"

This repository demonstrates how to build a conversational chatbot with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using the Hugging Face ecosystem.

## Getting Started

* This project relies on `python=3.12`. It was not tested with different versions
* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Once you have, `cd` into this repo and create the virtual environment (assuming you have `conda` installed) via
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
* Enter the virtual environment with `conda activate rag-chatbot-env`
* Install the packages in the repo root directory using `pip install -e .` (you only need the `-e` option if you intend to edit the source code in `rag_chatbot/`)
